# Jig

> A jig holds the workpiece and guides the tool, so every cut is repeatable.
> Your MCP server is the workpiece. The model is the tool.

**Jig is a testing workbench for MCP servers** — see what the model sees, measure what your server costs in context, and test what a model *actually does* with your tools.

## Why

MCP servers can't be tested like APIs. An API is deterministic: send a request, assert on the response. An MCP server "works" only if a **model** understands your tool descriptions, selects the right tool for a task, and fills the arguments correctly. That's a probabilistic surface — and today, everyone tests it by poking their server in a chat client and eyeballing the result.

Jig makes that surface visible, measurable, and regression-safe:

- 🔍 **Inspect** — the exact rendered context a model receives from your server. Not what your code says; what the wire says.
- 🧮 **Token budget** — what your server costs in context before the user types a word, per tool, per model tokenizer.
- 🎯 **Model bench** — give it a task in plain language; watch which tool a real model selects, with what arguments, across repeated runs.
- ✅ **Eval suites** — `prompt → expected tool call` test cases, versioned in git next to your server, runnable locally and in CI.

## Status

🚧 **Early development.** Building in public — watch the repo, or open an issue to tell us how you test your MCP server today (we read everything).

## Roadmap (short version)

1. Desktop workbench: connect (stdio / streamable HTTP), inspect, token budget, direct invoke, model bench — *in progress*
2. Local eval suites (`.jig/`) with honest, statistical scoring — selection rate across N runs, never single-run pass/fail
3. CI: `jig run` in your pipeline, PR annotations, regression gates

## License

TBD before first release. The suite format spec and CLI runner are intended to be open.
